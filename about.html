        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a student at Michigan State University, studying for a bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Information Technology.
            I'm aiming for a career in IT. I would like to pursue a job in web development, but the modern software engineering industry
            puts me off. Nevertheless, I enjoy it as a hobby and would like to continue learning about it, especially in the case an
            opportunity ever arises.
        </p>
        <h2>My favorite programming languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Go</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website was created for MI349 at MSU, as part of my IT Minor.</p>
